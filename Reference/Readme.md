# References - purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide reference data for the design process of TyD.

This is not TyD data. It's data that could have (should have) been expressed in TyD.

The is that looking at the patterns in the data can inform how we think about designing TyD. TyD is designed to express this kind of data, and we want to match the TyD spec to the real-life patterns of how it'll be used. So, when we consider a design element for TyD, these references provide concrete examples of how that would play out in real usage.
